Tutorial Dialogue Flow Chart

Manager Interactions:
First time you interact with him, you get what is written above. Each subsequent time, he makes a small comment after you click YES that acts as a hint, such as:
The item you choose doesn’t affect the amount you receive
Make someone smile today!
You’re the last customer so feel free to take your time chatting with the employees
Etc.

Employee Interactions:
Knock them out of a stupor or compliment their appearance or something along those lines to start a conversation. Sometimes the character might ask you an out-of-pocket question like “Do you ever feel lonely” or something and you respond
Once the character ends the interaction with you, you can choose what you wanted on the burrito or in the bowl
Emotions: smile, disappointment, surprised, neutral
Depending on the conversation, you get either the perfect amount, which makes a little thing pop up, or the incorrect amount or thing. 
Rice and beans: too much rice, forgets the beans
Protein: wrong one
Salsas: wrong one
Toppings: not enough
Cashier: incorrect amount tended
